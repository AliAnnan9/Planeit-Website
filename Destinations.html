             <P>Italy is known for the incredible food, tons of ancient ruins, and picturesque landscapes. Most of the visited places are Venice, a modern lovely city, Rome, which is a historical city full of intrigue. It is considered as a modern vibrant city full of fashion, architecture and nature.
                Venice, often called “The Floating City”and the “City of Canals”. Venice is a well-liked tourism
                destination because of its winding canals, impressive architecture, and lovely bridges.
                You can enjoy a variety of delicious Italian cuisines where you can taste the original pasta and
                pizza. Nothing is more beautiful than a raft ride exclusively down the Grand Canal to begin a journey to Venice.
                In an area where automobiles are eventually prohibited to reach the Church of Santa Chiara, the city's floating thoroughfare winds across the center of the city. A boat adventure is best enjoyed at sunrise when the canal is solely illuminated by golden light. On the other hand, there are several sights and activities in Rome. One of the most well-known places in the Rome is the Colosseum, also called the Flavian Amphitheater. The oval amphitheater was built completely of sand concrete and can accommodate up to 70,000 spectators at once!</P>
