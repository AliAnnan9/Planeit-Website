          <h3>The Main Idea</h3>
          <p>Traveling and exploring the world is an unforgettable activity that not everyone gets to experience. This topic was chosen specifically to give people a chance to live the feeling of planning for trips and learn how to manage everything pre-traveling and post-traveling. With that being said, we focused on 3 popular destinations desired by the majority: Italy, London, and Turkey, as we thought that all of the 3 gives a variety of cultural and historical vibes; and of course, enjoyable activities to do! In addition, because safety comes first, we added a topic about tips to maintain a safe trip when they are choosing to have a solo trip, or a family trip with children, this will really help in spreading the awareness. Also, packing the required things is quite stressful, especially for a new traveler. It can get hard to know what to carry with you, being afraid to forget a needed thing, so we made a checklist with all the requirements for an amazing trip in any season. However, while we were confident about the outcome, we did not expect the obstacles that faced us in the project. This essay will show the different circumstances faced, giving a reflection on how we overcame every difficulty.</p>

          <h3>The good team</h3>
          <p>First, talking about the pros, our overall experience was very pleasant. We started by splitting the tasks among each group member, and we helped each other throughout the whole process, which shows how well we were on team working skills. Also, all group members maintained an amazing time management, as we had a weekly 2 hours meeting on Sundays at the time that everyone agreed on, and the meeting’s agenda was to share our work so far, which everyone already uploaded on a shared drive, and try to solve some common issues that were quite challenging for all members. These issues will be discussed further.</p>

          <h3>The Design and code</h3>
          <p>As everything has pros and cons, we faced some technical issues building our website. Starting with the home page, when we reached the middle part of the home page, where the grid pattern should be placed behind the “Available destinations” heading. When we tried to keep it, it was making the text colors dim. We did a lot of searching on how to fix it until we decided to remove it. Also, we suffered to place the 3 images, so we used “position: absolute” in the CSS and kept trying different sizes using “left”, “top”, “right”, and “bottom”. We found it very helpful, and we used it in many parts of our work. Moreover, there was an obstacle in the interactional form, as we wanted to place it in the footer part but for some reason, it kept coming above the footer. To solve that, our tutor helped us find the issue and we fixed it. Moving on to the packing list web page, we thought that this will be a challenging one to do. Because we started the project as soon as we handled the document, we were still not familiar with how we should do it, but as we progressed through the course, we gained knowledge from the taught lessons and immediately applied what we learned. At first, we had a problem placing the main image that every other part of the page relies on. When we kept it as a background image and try to resize the whole page, it was moving. To solve that, we used a div and kept the image inside of it and it stayed stable. The checkbox had the same problem and was solved in a similar way, instead, we reused the “position: absolute” feature, and one of the group members wanted to make it more advanced so he used animation, once the user clicks the checklist, a crossed plane logo appears as a checkmark! The destination web page, on the other hand, is mainly images containing some text about the destinations. We wrote about them from our own travel experience and searched for further information. The main problem was the sizing of the images being changed as we zoom in and out of the page and open it from different PCs, even though we used “em”. In addition, when we used “float”, it was not moving either right or left. Luckily, we have the choice to use the positioning feature which worked as good as a float. The nav bar was also difficult to manage on each page, as the width was changing. Last but not least, the safety web page had quite similar obstacles, unless this time, the images were big and the page content was getting one over the other; so we had to cut each image and make it smaller. The id names were hard to manage too, as we were all working on the same project and will merge our work later on. But we came up with the idea to name the beginning of each id with an initial, and comment on each part of the code. Finally, when we finished all parts and wanted to merge our work into one HTML and CSS file, what was unexpected happened. Almost every page had minor issues that did not please us, for example, the images were not showing so we made sure they are actually there in the images folder, the nav bar changed on each page, and the layout of some pages changed. We used advanced CSS and had to make some changes in the file to handle any errors.</p>

          <h3>The Developer's Report</h3>
          <p>Digital sites enable enterprises to boost their promotion activities. The business benefit of the Plane-it website and the followed standards will be described in this developer's report.</p>
          <p>The website was represented by six pages. Each page contains specific content and information about every sub-topic. Also, an attractive color palette was used for the website layout to increase its attractiveness to attract more users and keep current users engaged with the website.</p>
          <p>For users to be inspired to use the website multiple times, essential features such as ease of use, simplicity, and intractability were applied. Moreover, the aesthetic quality and appearance encourage people of different ages who are willing to travel to reuse the website every time they want to plan a good trip. Because the website is easy to navigate and has a focused message, it will be easy to remember the content and therefore, choose this specific website before reaching their trip’s destination. In addition, the pages were built with a layout considering every page’s content, for example, the packing list page had a whole independent design displaying the requirements for every trip in any season. Nevertheless, the added animation feature which was the airplane design tick mark was interesting and encourages the user to use the website not only for planning a trip and learning about the three destinations but also using it as a checklist and passing it out as a recommendation for people who are willing to have a solo or family trip. Furthermore, the content was entertaining as it contains visuals and enthusiastic phrases. Something necessary that should be kept in mind is the writing font and style. It was chosen to best suit every target audience, making the website readable by every user. This was achieved by utilizing different header sizes, font styles, and CSS. </p>
          <p>When it comes to maintainability, the website needs to be built in a way that is adaptable to reasonable change. In order to ensure this the code needs to be well-organized, adhere to standards, and be commented. The comments were in a summarized and specific language that is understood by every reader. The code, however, does not have to be super long, the more it is advanced and understood able, the better, which is why only the required elements were used, and there were not much of unnecessary classes or Ids. Nevertheless, the names of IDs and divs were self-explanatory.</p>
          <p>Plane-it websites conform to standards of web accessibility by utilizing several elements and tags, making them perceivable, understandable, and operable. For example, images will be used as an alternative to illustrate non-text content, and for adding a demonstration of the destination’s sites, food and activities. Moreover, links were named individually, and styles such as a rounded colored circle appearing (in the navbar) when hovering were added to differentiate between text and clickable links. Also, text and images will be enlarged smoothly when required, making everything understandable, readable, and hopefully helpful. </p>
          <p>To sum up, the website will be performed utilizing the most efficient and straightforward approaches, which will be used in a practical way that satisfies the desires and expectations of the user.</p>

          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>To sum up, the website-building process was an interesting journey we learned a lot from. We developed our skills and worked hard to come up with the result of our website. All of the group members had improved their problem-solving skills and worked together as a successful team that overcome challenges together. If a similar project was to happen in the future, we would have improved our java script proficiency and we will have the best web development experience. </p>
